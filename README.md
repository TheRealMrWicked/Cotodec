# Yosuga no Sora Decompiled
This project is attempts to create program that can decompile Cotoph Script Executables (csx) files.

Usage: cotodec --export --input /path/to/csx/file/name.csx --output /absolute/path/to/output/folder")

Please note that the relative path of the .csx file can be used but you must use the **absolute path** for the output location, it will look something like:

C:\Users\MrWicked\Documents\Cotodec\output

As usual help would be appreciated by making a **pull request**.

This program was originally created by [andreili](https://github.com/andreili).
